pageTitle: Introduction to FreeCodeCamp Microservices Certification in ASP.NET Core
---
[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a great learning resource. When I first started taking Javascript seriously, FreeCodeCamp was the single greatest resource in my journey - but the biggest problem I have with FreeCodeCamp is that their curriculum is based mostly on JavaScript _alone_. They are adding more and more non-JavaScript material, but the lion's share of their coursework is JS-centric.

The great thing about their [APIs and Microservices Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/) is that you can complete it in whatever language you choose. When submitting your project, FreeCodeCamp uses the URL you provide and tests the API using AJAX - meaning they never even see your code, only the end result of your API.

Because of this, the APIs and Microservices Certification is a great opportunity to learn whatever backend language you want. Any server-side web language and runtime can be used, from PHP to NodeJS to Ruby to ASP.NET. In this series, you will learn how to build ASP.NET applications while completing the requirements for the APIs and Microservices Certification. I'll walk you through the entire process from beginning to end, making no assumptions about your knowledge of ASP.NET Core. I assume that you have some experience in programming C#, but for those of you who don't, there are many great resources for learning C# online for free on [the Microsoft website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/csharp).
